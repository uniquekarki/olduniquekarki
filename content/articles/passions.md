I lost my individuality when I became addicted to a drug known as “social media”. I felt the compulsion to do the things that weren’t aligned with what I was. When others posted a selfie, I had to post it too. When others wrote about something, I had to write about it too. Soon I became only a reflection of the people around me. I killed my passions and busied myself with what the outer world labeled as “normal” for me. I felt as if I was participating in a race with no goal whatsoever. This is what society tends to do; dims the fire of passion within us and pushes us into the paths that others think are a good fit for us.

We have an obsession with trying to fit in and in its pursuit, we settle for mediocrity. We have become mediocre in thinking, reasoning, and actions because we don't think for ourselves. We lie to ourselves, do things that are untrue to ourselves and settle for less. We never challenge ourselves to exceed our capacity and trying to do what's safe and normal, we kill the thrill and passions of life.

Take a moment to evaluate all the things that busy you. Question every action with great curiosity and answer with utmost honesty. Are you doing what you're doing for yourself or because the world has persuaded you into doing it? Are you just doing the things you do because the world labels it as a “normal behavior” for your nature? When you get too many “no”s you have an answer to your individuality - it’s non-existent. Your actions are a mere reflection of the society and people that surround you. It is at this point that you have to search for something that you enjoy genuinely.

I’m not suggesting abandoning your ways of primary income; these are necessary to sustain life and have a sense of security. But forcing yourself to believe that fulfillment in life comes from this work is absurd. What you need is passions in life and integrate them with the “absurdities of life” in an elegant manner.

It is not going to be easy. Your passions might feel hard to continue with the criticism that you face. There will be times in which you will feel alone trying to keep these passions alive, this is because it is a fight that you’ll have to fight alone. This is a battle you have to fight alone to keep your individuality alive. It is your responsibility to go on the search for ever going search for passion and fulfillment in life. You will be all alone in its pursuit but you must go ahead.

In the words of Rabindra Nath Tagore,
>“যদি তোর ডাক শুনে কেউ না আসে তবে একলা চলো রে । একলা চলো একলা চলো একলা চলো একলা চলো রে ।।”

Which means,
>“If there is no-one responding to your call - then go on all alone”
