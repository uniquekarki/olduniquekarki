>Who are we if not for our questions?<br>
>Where would humanity be if we were afraid to ask questions?<br> 
>Can humans progress any further if essential questions remain unasked?<br>
>Can we know about ourselves if we are incapable of questioning about the self?<br>
>How can we know about our existence?<br>

Pondering over these questions will only scratch the surface of the importance of questioning.

Over time, we have developed a capacity for critical thinking. The difference between the capacity of our brain, in comparison to other beings, seems unfathomable. So why waste such capacity by submitting to the ordinary. We have the right to question the existence of everything. So why not exercise that right to ask questions about the very foundation of our belief. All the things we learn in life, consciousness, morality, values are developed or discovered through our questions. If the question we ask, even to ourselves, is of weak foundation, our belief would be fragile from the root itself.

Only when we rigorously question what we believe in do we develop a sound base. Otherwise, beliefs with weak bases would fall even by the blow of the simplest of questions.

We should not be afraid to question, fearing the answers we might get. Let your beliefs fall apart if they cannot withstand such blows. What I would suggest is to be a skeptic; dismiss everything you believe. Start constructing what you believe in with a sound base and test them through intense questioning.  Only then would you be sure about what you truly believe. If the doctrine you follow forbids you to ask questions, rethink the belief in the doctrine itself as such blind and bad faith only leads to weak thinking.

If your questions pierce through your heart, let it be so. Do not be afraid of it.

>Beliefs are like shiny rocks, and questioning is like hammering them. Only when you have tested it with thunderous blows of examination will you have verified it to be a diamond.
