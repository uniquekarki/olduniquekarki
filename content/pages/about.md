Hello! Iâ€™m Unique Karki. I'm an undergrad student studying computer science at Kathmandu University. I'm interested in the field of Artificial Intelligence and would like to persue career in it. I have done a few projects in prediction system, Nepali Speech Recognition System, Face Recognition and Web Development. 

Apart from acamedics, I am fond of music. I play few musical instruments such as guitar, harmonium, madal and flute. I'm also trying to learn French for fun in my free time.

I'm also an avid book reader and philosophical fiction is my favorite genre. Some of my favorite writers are Friedrich Nietzsche, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Franz Kafka, Albert Camus and George Orwell. So my writings might be heavily influnced by them.

This blog is a vent for my thoughts and some of the posts might look like unrelated mess. So bear with me. 

Thank you for visiting my blog.
