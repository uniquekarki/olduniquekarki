&lt;p&gt;Who are we if not for our questions?&lt;br&gt;
Where would humanity be if we were afraid to ask questions?&lt;br&gt; 
Can humans progress any further if essential questions remain unasked?&lt;br&gt;
Can we know about ourselves if we are incapable of questioning about the self?&lt;br&gt;
How can we know about our existence?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pondering over these questions will only scratch the surface of the importance of questioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, we have developed a capacity for critical thinking. The difference between the capacity of our brain, in comparison to other beings, seems unfathomable. So why waste such capacity by submitting to the ordinary. We have the right to question the existence of everything. So why not exercise that right to ask questions about the very foundation of our belief. All the things we learn in life, consciousness, morality, values are developed or discovered through our questions. If the question we ask, even to ourselves, is of weak foundation, our belief would be fragile from the root itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only when we rigorously question what we believe in do we develop a sound base. Otherwise, beliefs with weak bases would fall even by the blow of the simplest of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should not be afraid to question, fearing the answers we might get. Let your beliefs fall apart if they cannot withstand such blows. What I would suggest is to be a skeptic; dismiss everything you believe. Start constructing what you believe in with a sound base and test them through intense questioning.  Only then would you be sure about what you truly believe. If the doctrine you follow forbids you to ask questions, rethink the belief in the doctrine itself as such blind and bad faith only leads to weak thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your questions pierce through your heart, let it be so. Do not be afraid of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beliefs are like shiny rocks, and questioning is like hammering them. Only when you have tested it with thunderous blows of examination will you have verified it to be a diamond.&lt;/p&gt;

I felt the compulsion to do the things that weren’t aligned with what I was. When others posted a selfie, I had to post it too. When others wrote about something, I had to write about it too. Soon I became only a reflection of the people around me. I killed my passions and busied myself with what the outer world labeled as “normal” for me. I felt as if I was participating in a race with no goal whatsoever. This is what society tends to do; dims the fire of passion within us and pushes us into the paths that others think are a good fit for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an obsession with trying to fit in and in its pursuit, we settle for mediocrity. We have become mediocre in thinking, reasoning, and actions because we don't think for ourselves. We lie to ourselves, do things that are untrue to ourselves and settle for less. We never challenge ourselves to exceed our capacity and trying to do what's safe and normal, we kill the thrill and passions of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to evaluate all the things that busy you. Question every action with great curiosity and answer with utmost honesty. Are you doing what you're doing for yourself or because the world has persuaded you into doing it? Are you just doing the things you do because the world labels it as a “normal behavior” for your nature? When you get too many “no”s you have an answer to your individuality - it’s non-existent. Your actions are a mere reflection of the society and people that surround you. It is at this point that you have to search for something that you enjoy genuinely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not suggesting abandoning your ways of primary income; these are necessary to sustain life and have a sense of security. But forcing yourself to believe that fulfillment in life comes from this work is absurd. What you need is passions in life and integrate them with the “absurdities of life” in an elegant manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not going to be easy. Your passions might feel hard to continue with the criticism that you face. There will be times in which you will feel alone trying to keep these passions alive, this is because it is a fight that you’ll have to fight alone. This is a battle you have to fight alone to keep your individuality alive. It is your responsibility to go on the search for ever going search for passion and fulfillment in life. You will be all alone in its pursuit but you must go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the words of Rabindra Nath Tagore,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“যদি তোর ডাক শুনে কেউ না আসে তবে একলা চলো রে । একলা চলো একলা চলো একলা চলো একলা চলো রে ।।”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which means,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If there is no-one responding to your call - then go on all alone”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I stood at the bottom of a long flight of stairs with nothing but darkness around me. The darkness around me was nothing like I’ve ever felt before; it felt dead. Nothing 
was alive except me and the god that was sitting on a throne at the top of the stairs. The divine god was faceless but large and overpowering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a great sense of faith and devotion in me towards him that prevented me from even lifting my head. I walked up the stairs bowing down. The closer I got, the more 
of his power I felt and the lifelessness around me gradually faded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to his feet, still bowing down, I leaned forward to touch his feet but then I suddenly stopped. Something in me changed and my thoughts couldn’t calm down; never did 
I know that next moment I would do something unthinkable. In a moment of great confusion, I suddenly got up. Either god must have shrunk or I grew enormously, but we were 
of the same size. I grabbed his neck and lifted him off the ground with ease. After a brief moment of struggle, he slowed down and finally died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next moment the dead blacked void came back and covered everything. The ground beneath me disappeared and the abyss engulfed me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year ago I dreamt this dream which still haunts me. This dream stands out from the rest of my dreams that I could recall because I believe it marked the beginning of my journey into nihilism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always been influenced by religion and its moral values and virtues. Every decision that I made has been influenced by religion on some level. But now, as I began to rationally disintegrate this moral value, I found such values to be misleading. This new way of looking into life is a great revelation but it certainly made all the values and virtues meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could finally relate to the sentiment of Freidrich Nietzche’s infamous quote, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him…”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this nihilistic vision, I became the sinner of all sinners because I killed the god who was so dear to me for most of my life. But was I a sinner? After all, the concept of sin must be irrelevant now that my faith collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there such a thing called sin or it is a mere concept the religion created to keep humanity in order? Is “sin” just another pillar of religion, the same religion whose whole foundation I destroyed? Is there any moral principle left to guide me into the eternal truth or was there an actual moral principle to begin with? Is there anything in existence that has an inherent value?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still many questions left unanswered, but one thing I know for sure is that &lt;em&gt;I killed god and I too died that moment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="philosophy"></category><category term="nihilism"></category><category term="dream"></category></entry></feed>
